    <h3><em>Fender or Gibson</em></h3>
    <p>Here is a quote from Jeff Beck regarding guitars.</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/jeff_beck_1015740?src=t_fender">
                          The Les Paul was more challenging because of the weight of it, but the tone was there that the Fender will never have 
                          and vice versa. So you have to make a decision as to what you're going to have as your main instrument. 
                          After seeing Hendrix, I thought, 'I'll stick with the 'Strat.' Jeff Beck"
